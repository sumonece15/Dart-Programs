###Program -01

void main() {
int n = 3;

switch (n) {

case 1:
print("Value is 1");
break;

case 2:
print("Value is 2");
break;

case 3:
print("Value is 3");
break;

case 4:
print("Value is 4");
break;

default:
print("Out of range");
break;

 }
 
}

<p align="justify">
1. Variable Declaration (int n = 3;):
Declares an integer variable n and initializes it with the value 3.
</p>

<p align="justify">
2. Switch Statement (switch (n) { ... }):
Evaluate the value of n and compare it with different cases using case statements. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. The code in the default block is executed if no match is found.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3. Output:
In this case, the value of n is 3, so the program matches the case 3 and prints "Value is 3."
</p>


###Program -02

void main() {

int Roll_num = 90014;

switch (Roll_num) {

case 90009:
print("My name is Joseph");
break;

case 90010:
print("My name is Peter");
break;

case 90011:
print("My name is Devansh");
break;

default:
print("Roll number is not found");

 }

}

<p align="justify">
1. Variable Declaration (int Roll_num = 90014;):
Declares an integer variable Roll_num and initializes it with the value 90014.
</p>

<p align="justify">
2. Switch Statement (switch (Roll_num) { ... }):
Evaluate the value of Roll_num and compare it with different cases using case statements. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. The code in the default block is executed if no match is found.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3. Output:
In this case, the value of Roll_num is 90014, and there is no matching case. Therefore, the program executes the default block and prints "Roll number is not found."
</p>

<p align="justify">
Both programs demonstrate the use of the switch statement to evaluate a variable and execute different blocks of code based on its value.
